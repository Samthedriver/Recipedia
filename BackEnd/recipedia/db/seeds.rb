  category: 'entree',
  ingredients: "1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts
Kosher or coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 teaspoon minced garlic
4 cups chicken broth, preferably low-sodium
1 package (1 pound) penne rigate or ziti
1 1/2 cups heavy (whipping) cream or half-and-half, warmed
1 cup freshly grated Parmesan, plus more for serving
1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley (optional)",
  instructions: "Cut the chicken breasts into 1-inch pieces. Season with salt and pepper.
Melt the butter in a very large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken, in batches if necessary, and sauté until nicely browned on the outside, but still a bit pink inside, about 4 minutes (the pieces don’t have to be browned on all sides; two sides is fine). Remove the chicken and set aside on a plate.
Do not clean the pan! Those brown bits on the bottom of the pan are going to add flavor to the sauce. Add the garlic to the pan and sauté over medium heat until you can smell it, 30 seconds. Turn the heat to high, add the chicken broth, and scrape the bottom of the pan to loosen up all of those delicious caramelized bits. Bring to a simmer, lower to medium heat, and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the pasta, stir well, and simmer until the pasta starts to soften, about 8 minutes. Stir in the warm cream and the browned chicken with any juices that have accumulated on the plate. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is tender, most of the liquid has been absorbed, and the chicken is cooked through, about 4 minutes more.
Stir in the Parmesan until well incorporated, and adjust the seasonings.
Transfer the mixture to a serving bowl and sprinkle with the parsley, if desired. Serve hot and pass extra Parmesan at the table.
Alfredo Add-Ins
When you add the Parmesan in Step 4, you can add any of the following to the pot, alone or in combination; stir over medium heat for another minute or two.
1 tablespoon puréed chipotles in adobo sauce
4 cups sliced mushrooms, sautéed
3 cups lightly cooked tiny broccoli florets
2 tablespoons fresh herbs, such as oregano, thyme, or parsley
Or, you can serve up portions of Chicken Alfredo Pasta for those who like it plain and simple, and add proportionate amounts of any of the add-ins to the pot.

  ingredients: "1-1/2 to 1-3/4 lb. Cortland apples (about 4 medium)
1 lb.Granny Smith apples (about 2-1/2 medium)
2 tsp. fresh lemon juice
2/3 cup packed light brown sugar
1/4 cup plus 1 Tbs. granulated sugar
3 Tbs. cornstarch
1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon; more to taste
1/4 tsp. kosher salt
1/8 tsp. ground nutmeg
1 large egg white
2 tsp. unsalted butter, softened, plus 1 Tbs. cold unsalted butter cut into small (1/4-inch) cubes
4 to 6 Tbs. all-purpose flour",
  instructions: "Peel the apples, cut each in half from top to bottom, remove the cores with a melon baller, and trim the ends with a paring knife. Lay the apples, cut side down, on a cutting board. Cut the Cortland apples (below left) crosswise into 3/4-inch pieces, and then halve each piece diagonally. Cut the Granny Smith apples (below right) crosswise into 1/4-inch slices, leaving them whole. Put the apples in a large bowl and toss with the lemon juice.
  Combine the brown sugar, 1/4 cup of the granulated sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, kosher salt, and nutmeg in a small bowl. (Don’t add this to the fruit yet.)
In a small dish, lightly beat the egg white with 1 teaspoon water. Set aside.
Butter a 9-inch ovenproof glass (Pyrex) pie plate, including the rim, with the 2 tsp. of softened butter.
Rub 2 to 3 Tbs. of flour into the surface of a pastry cloth, forming a circle about 15 inches across, and also into a rolling pin stocking. If you don’t have a pastry cloth, rub the flour into a large, smooth-weave, cotton kitchen towel and use a floured rolling pin. Roll one of the disks of dough into a circle that’s 1/8 inch thick and about 15 inches across.
Lay the rolling pin across the upper third of the dough circle; lift the pastry cloth to gently drape the dough over the pin and then roll the pin toward you, wrapping the remaining dough loosely around it. Hold the rolling pin over the near edge of the pie plate. Allowing for about a 1-inch overhang, unroll the dough away from you, easing it into the contours of the pan. If the dough isn’t centered in the pan, gently adjust it and then lightly press it into the pan. Take care not to stretch the dough. If it tears, simply press it back together—the dough is quite forgiving.
Brush the bottom and sides of the dough with a light coating of the egg-white wash (you won’t need all of it). Leaving a 1/4-inch overhang, cut around the edge of the dough with kitchen shears.
Combine the sugar mixture with the apples and toss to coat well. Mound the apples in the pie plate, rearranging the fruit as needed to make the pile compact. Dot the apples with the 1 Tbs. cold butter cubes.
Rub another 2 to 3 Tbs. flour into the surface of the pastry cloth and stocking. Roll the remaining dough into a circle that’s 1/8 inch thick and about 15 inches across. Use the rolling pin to move the dough. As you unroll the dough, center it on top of the apples. Place your hands on either side of the top crust of the pie and ease the dough toward the center, giving the dough plenty of slack. Leaving a 3/4-inch overhang, trim the top layer of dough around the rim of the pie plate. Fold the top layer of dough under the bottom layer, tucking the two layers of dough together. Press a lightly floured fork around the edge of the dough to seal it, or flute the edge of the dough with lightly floured fingers.
Lightly brush the top with cold water and sprinkle the surface with the remaining 1 Tbs. sugar. Make steam vents in the dough by poking the tip of a paring knife through it in a few places; it’s important to vent well so that the steam from the cooking apples won’t build up and crack the top of the crust.
Cover the rim of the pie with aluminum foil bands. This will prevent the edge of the crust from overbrowning.
Place a rimmed baking sheet or an aluminum foil drip pan on the oven rack below the pie to catch any juices that overflow during baking. Set the pie on the rack above.
Bake until the top and bottom crusts are golden brown and the juices are bubbling, 60 to 75 minutes; to thicken, the juices must boil, so look for the bubbles through the steam vents or through cracks near the edges of the pie and listen for the sound of bubbling juices. During the last 5 minutes of baking, remove the foil bands from the edges of the pie. Cool the pie at least 3 hours and up to overnight before serving.",

  category: 'dessert',
  ingredients: "Cream Cheese is the key ingredient in the filling and is also the main structure and flavor of the cheesecake. Full fat cream cheese is the best option for the creamiest cheesecake with the best flavor.
Sugar sweetens the cheesecake filling.
Flour is used in a small quantity to help stabilize the filling and keep it dense.
Eggs are the binding ingredient and help create a silky smooth texture.
Sour Cream adds a slightly tangy flavor and contributes to the creaminess of the filling.
Vanilla and Lemon Zest only serve to flavor the cheesecake. These two ingredients create the iconic classic cheesecake flavor.",
  instructions: "Prep: At least 1 hour and up to 12 hours before preparing the cheesecake, set out the cream cheese, eggs, and sour cream to come to room temperature. It is extremely important for a creamy cheesecake that your ingredients are not cold. You will need a 9 inch (23 cm) spring form pan for this recipe. Right before starting the crust, preheat your oven to 375 F (190 C) and position your oven rack in the center position. (Do not use the convection setting if you oven has it for this recipe)
Prepare the Crust: Place the graham crackers in a food processor and pulse until you have cookie crumbs. Alternatively, you can put them in a ziplock bag and use a rolling pin to roll back and forth over them until they are crumbs. Place the cookie crumbs in a medium bowl and mix with the sugar and melted butter. Firmly press the crust into the bottom and about 1 inch (2.5 cm) up the side of a 9 inch (23 cm) spring form pan.
Bake & Cool Crust: Bake the crust at 375 F (190 C) for 8 minutes. Set the crust aside to cool while you prepare the filling.
Cream the Sugar & Cream Cheese: Increase the oven temperature to 475 F (246 C)- it needs to be preheating for at least 20 minutes before the cheesecake goes in so that it truly is hot enough. In the bowl of a stand mixer fit with a paddle attachment, or in a large bowl with a hand mixer, combine the cream cheese, sugar, and flour and beat on medium speed for 6 minutes, until light and fluffy. Turn the mixer down to low speed.
Beat in the eggs one at a time while the mixer is running on low speed. Add the sour cream, vanilla, and lemon zest. Turn off the mixer and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure all of the mixture is evenly combined.
Bake: Pour the mixture into the prepared crust. It will completely fill the spring form pan. Place on the center rack in a 475 F (246 C) oven for 8 minutes. Leave the door closed and reduce the oven temperature to 200 F (93 C) for 1 hour. Turn the oven off (again, do not open the oven door!) and leave the cheesecake in the off oven for 1 more hour.
Cool: Let the cheesecake cool and then refrigerate for at least 6-8 hours, before removing the sides of the pan and slicing.
Store: Cover the cheesecake with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. To store the cheesecake in the freezer, freeze it uncovered until solid, then wrap it well in plastic wrap and/or foil and store in the freezer for up to 3 months.",

  category: 'entree',
  ingredients: "Sauce:

1 1/2 pound cremini mushrooms, roughly chopped
1/2 pound shiitake mushrooms, roughly chopped
Salt
1 generous cup of chopped onions
1/4 cup olive oil plus more for keeping the noodles from sticking to each other
4 cloves garlic, chopped (about 4 teaspoons)
1 6-ounce can tomato paste
2 cups tomato sauce
1 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes (I recommend Muir Glen brand with added basil)
1 cup water
1 Tbsp dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 Tbsp sugar

Lasagna:

2 10-ounce boxes frozen chopped spinach, thawed, squeezed in clean towel of excess moisture
1 lb lasagna noodles (16 to 20 noodles)
1 15-or-16-ounce container of ricotta cheese
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil
1/4 pound pecorino cheese (or Parmesan), grated (about 1 cup)
1 pound shredded mozzarella cheese (about 4 cups),
  instructions: Sauté the mushrooms: Place mushrooms in a large (6 to 8 quart), sauté pan on high or medium high heat. Stir them with a wooden spoon or shake the pan from time to time. You may hear them squeak.
  Sprinkle salt over the mushrooms. The mushrooms will sizzle and then start to release water. (Note that you are not adding fat at this point to the pan; this method of cooking mushrooms in their own moisture is called dry sautéing.)

Once the mushrooms start to release water into the pan, stir in the chopped onions. Cook until the mushrooms are no longer releasing moisture and the mushroom water has boiled away, about 5 minutes more.

2 Build the sauce with the mushrooms, tomatoes, and rest of the sauce ingredients: Add the olive oil to the mushrooms and stir to coat. Sauté the mushrooms and onions for about a minute.  Add the garlic and cook for another minute.
Stir in the tomato paste, cook for a minute longer. Reserve 1 cup of the tomato sauce (it will go in the bottom of the casserole dish), and put the remaining cup of tomato sauce into the pot with the mushrooms.  Add the large can of crushed tomatoes.  Add one cup of water.

Stir in the thyme, sugar, and red pepper flakes. If you are using dried basil instead of fresh, add it now.

Bring to a simmer, then lower the heat and simmer on a low simmer, for 20 minutes.

3 Boil and drain the lasagna noodles: Once sauce is simmering, salt the boiling pasta water, and add the dry lasagna noodles to the boiling water.  (The water should be at a vigorous, rolling boil.) Stir gently, making sure that the noodles are not sticking to each other. Set the timer for 8 minutes, or however long is indicated on the package of the noodles. Cook uncovered on a high boil.

When the noodles are ready (al dente, cooked through but still firm to the bite), drain the noodles in a colander, and rinse them to cool them with cold water.  As you rinse them, gently separate them with your fingers so they don't stick to each other.
Prepare a couple large cookie sheets or baking sheets by spreading a tablespoon of olive oil over the baking sheets.

Place the lasagna noodles on the sheets, gently coating them with a bit of that olive oil, and spreading them out. This will help keep them from sticking to each other while you finish the sauce and prepare the layered casserole.

4 Assemble the lasagna: Turn off the heat on the stovetop for the sauce. Preheat the oven to 350°F.

Spread the one cup of reserved tomato sauce over the bottom of a large (preferably 10x15-inch) casserole dish. (If your casserole dish is smaller, you may need to add another layer as you go through this step.)
Place a layer of lasagna noodles down over the tomato sauce, slightly overlapping. (For our 10x15-inch dish, we ultimately fit 3 layers of noodles, each layer with 6 noodles.  Then we had 2 extra noodles on which to nosh.)

Sprinkle half of the ricotta cheese over the noodles.

Sprinkle half of the defrosted, drained, and excess moisture squeezed out spinach over the ricotta.

Sprinkle half of the Mozzarella cheese over the spinach, and just a quarter of the pecorino cheese.
Then spoon 1/3 of your mushroom sauce over the Mozzarella.

Sprinkle half of the fresh basil over the sauce if using.

5 Repeat layers: Repeat the layering process. Place a second layer of noodles over the sauce. Spread the remaining ricotta, spinach, and Mozzarella over the noodles. Sprinkle another quarter of the pecorino along with the Mozzarella. Top with another third of the mushroom sauce and the remaining fresh basil.
Layer your final layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread the remaining sauce over the lasagna noodles, and sprinkle with the remaining pecorino or parmesan cheese.

6 Cover with foil and bake: Pull out a sheet of aluminum foil large enough to cover the casserole dish. Spread a little olive oil over the inside of the piece of foil (the side that will have contact with the lasagna). Place the foil over the casserole dish and crimp the edges.

Bake at 350°F for 25 minutes, then remove the foil and bake uncovered for an additional 25 minutes.

Take the lasagna out of the oven when done and let it rest 10 minutes before cutting to serve. Once made, the lasagna will last a week in the fridge.",
